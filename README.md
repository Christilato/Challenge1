Homework Challenge 1

## Description
In this project, I was provided an existing set of HTML and CSS code for a digital marketing company. The original code, while functional, did not include the proper accessibility features based on W3C Accessibility Standards.

My objective was to refactor this code for accessibility by doing the following: adding semantic HTML elements wherever possible, reviewing and reorganizing the code to ensure a logical overall structure, adding accessible alt attributes to icons/images, ensuring sequential order of all heading attributes, updating the title element with a concise, descriptive title.
